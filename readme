invoice.py

Given one or more invoice IDs, generate printable HTML invoices.

Invoice template is based on HTML/CSS and Mako. It's very easy to customize.

Example: invoice.py file:///home/user/gnucash/mybook.gnucash 000123

Notes:
* Invoice IDs are passed in as strings. Using GnuCash defaults, you must
  include the leading zeros.
* Tested on Ubuntu 12.04 with python, python-mako, gnucash and gnucash-python
  packages.
